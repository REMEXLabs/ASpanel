# Accessibility Support Panel (ASpanel) 

A panel for accessibility settings that can be included in web sites. See the [test page (in German)](https://remexlabs.github.io/ASpanel/).

## Build
You need to have [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system aswell as the [Gulp CLI](https://gulpjs.com). Then run `npm install` in the root directory to get the local dependencies ready.

To build the project you need to run `gulp` inside the root folder. This will generate a deployable version into the `dist` folder. To develop you can use `gulp watch` to automatically rebuild when a file changes. Simply run a server from the dist directory to preview you changes, e.g. by running `php -S localhost:7000`.

## Usage
